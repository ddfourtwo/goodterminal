      "taskId": 1,
      "taskTitle": "Create Installation Script Framework",
      "complexityScore": 6,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 4,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the installation script framework into these subtasks: 1) Core script structure with shebang and error handling, 2) Logging and helper functions implementation, 3) Command-line argument parsing system, 4) Modular installation phase framework",
      "reasoning": "This task involves creating a foundational bash script with multiple components including error handling, logging, argument parsing, and a modular structure. The complexity comes from ensuring cross-platform compatibility and proper error handling, but the task is well-defined with clear requirements and example code."
    },
    {
      "taskId": 2,
      "taskTitle": "Implement OS Detection and Package Management",
      "complexityScore": 7,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 5,
      "expansionPrompt": "Divide the OS detection and package management task into: 1) OS detection function for all supported platforms, 2) Package manager detection and validation, 3) Platform-specific installation functions for apt/yum/pacman/brew, 4) Error handling and recovery mechanisms, 5) Version checking implementation",
      "reasoning": "This task requires handling multiple operating systems and package managers with different behaviors. It involves complex error handling across diverse environments and needs to gracefully handle various failure scenarios. The cross-platform nature and need to manage dependencies across different systems increases complexity."
    },
    {
      "taskId": 3,
      "taskTitle": "Configure Basic tmux Environment",
      "complexityScore": 4,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 3,
      "expansionPrompt": "Split the tmux configuration task into: 1) Core tmux settings and keybindings setup, 2) Tmux Plugin Manager installation and configuration, 3) Status bar and session persistence implementation",
      "reasoning": "This task is relatively straightforward with a clear scope. It involves configuring tmux with standard settings, installing a plugin manager, and setting up basic functionality. The complexity is moderate as it requires understanding tmux configuration syntax but doesn't involve complex logic or cross-platform considerations."
    },
    {
      "taskId": 4,
      "taskTitle": "Set Up Basic Neovim Configuration",
      "complexityScore": 5,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 3,
      "expansionPrompt": "Organize the Neovim configuration into these subtasks: 1) Core editor settings and Lazy.nvim setup, 2) Essential plugins installation and configuration, 3) Keybindings and syntax highlighting implementation",
      "reasoning": "Setting up Neovim involves Lua configuration and plugin management. The complexity comes from configuring multiple plugins to work together and ensuring proper initialization order. However, this is a basic configuration without advanced features like LSP, making it moderately complex."
    },
    {
      "taskId": 5,
      "taskTitle": "Implement Custom Zsh Configuration",
      "complexityScore": 5,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 4,
      "expansionPrompt": "Divide the Zsh configuration task into: 1) Core Zsh settings and history management, 2) Completion system configuration, 3) Custom prompt with git integration, 4) Aliases, functions, and fuzzy matching setup",
      "reasoning": "Creating a custom Zsh configuration without relying on Oh-My-Zsh requires understanding Zsh's native features. The task involves configuring multiple components including completion, history, prompt customization, and fuzzy matching. The complexity is moderate as it requires shell scripting knowledge but has clear requirements."
    },
    {
      "taskId": 6,
      "taskTitle": "Implement Tmux-Neovim Integration",
      "complexityScore": 6,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 3,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the Tmux-Neovim integration into: 1) Vim-tmux-navigator plugin setup in Neovim, 2) Tmux configuration for compatible navigation, 3) Clipboard integration and status indicator synchronization",
      "reasoning": "This task requires coordinating configurations between two separate tools to work seamlessly together. The complexity comes from ensuring consistent behavior across both environments and handling edge cases like nested sessions. It requires understanding both tools' APIs and how they interact."
    },
    {
      "taskId": 7,
      "taskTitle": "Implement LSP and Autocompletion in Neovim",
      "complexityScore": 8,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 5,
      "expansionPrompt": "Divide the LSP and autocompletion implementation into: 1) Mason and LSP server configuration, 2) Language-specific LSP setup (Lua, Python, TypeScript, Bash), 3) Nvim-cmp and autocompletion sources configuration, 4) Snippets integration with LuaSnip, 5) Keybindings and UI customization for LSP features",
      "reasoning": "This is one of the most complex tasks as it involves configuring multiple interdependent systems (LSP, completion, snippets) that must work together seamlessly. It requires deep understanding of Neovim's plugin ecosystem and the LSP protocol. Each language server has its own configuration requirements and potential issues."
    },
    {
      "taskId": 8,
      "taskTitle": "Implement Mosh Integration",
      "complexityScore": 4,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 3,
      "expansionPrompt": "Split the Mosh integration task into: 1) Cross-platform Mosh installation handling, 2) Firewall configuration and network setup, 3) Helper scripts and documentation creation",
      "reasoning": "This task involves installing and configuring Mosh across different platforms and setting up firewall rules. The complexity is moderate as it requires understanding networking concepts and platform-specific installation methods, but the scope is relatively narrow and well-defined."

      "taskId": 9,
      "taskTitle": "Implement User Customization System",
      "complexityScore": 7,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 4,
      "expansionPrompt": "Organize the user customization system into: 1) Directory structure and configuration file templates, 2) Tmux and Zsh customization hooks, 3) Neovim plugin and configuration extension system, 4) Documentation and example customizations",
      "reasoning": "Creating a customization system requires designing a flexible architecture that allows user modifications without breaking core functionality. The complexity comes from ensuring that customizations are properly loaded and don't conflict with base configurations. It requires careful consideration of extension points and potential user modifications."
