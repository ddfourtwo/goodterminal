# GoodTerminal - Single-Install Server Development Environment PRD

## Overview  
GoodTerminal is a powerful command-line development environment that can be installed on any Linux or macOS server with a single command. It solves the problem of inconsistent and underpowered development environments when working on remote servers. Instead of struggling with basic vim and poor navigation on each new server, GoodTerminal provides a consistent, modern terminal experience with advanced features across all machines.

## Core Features  

### 1. Single Command Installation
- **What it does**: Allows users to install the entire development environment with one command
- **Why it's important**: Eliminates hours of manual setup time and ensures consistency
- **How it works**: A unified install script detects the OS, installs required packages, and configures all tools

### 2. Seamless Integration of Tools
- **What it does**: Integrates tmux and neovim with unified navigation keys
- **Why it's important**: Creates a cohesive development environment with minimal friction
- **How it works**: Configures vim-tmux-navigator to enable seamless movement between tmux panes and neovim splits

### 3. Modern Development Features
- **What it does**: Provides LSP support, autocompletion, syntax highlighting, and fuzzy finding
- **Why it's important**: Brings IDE-like features to the terminal environment
- **How it works**: Configures neovim with appropriate plugins and sensible defaults

### 4. Enhanced Shell Environment
- **What it does**: Offers an Oh-My-Zsh style shell with intelligent autocompletion and fuzzy matching
- **Why it's important**: Improves productivity and reduces typing errors
- **How it works**: Custom zsh configuration that provides rich features without the overhead of oh-my-zsh

### 5. Cross-Platform Compatibility
- **What it does**: Works identically across Ubuntu, Debian, RHEL, CentOS, Arch Linux, and macOS
- **Why it's important**: Ensures a consistent experience regardless of server OS
- **How it works**: Platform-specific installation routines that achieve the same end result

### 6. Resilient Connections
- **What it does**: Integrates Mosh for reliable connections that survive network changes
- **Why it's important**: Prevents lost work due to dropped SSH connections
- **How it works**: Configures Mosh as an alternative to SSH that maintains session state

## User Experience  

### User Personas
